### Dependencies Configured âœ…
- **egui/eframe**: Cross-platform GUI framework
- **global-hotkey**: Global hotkey registration (Windows)
- **chrono**: Date/time handling for file timestamps
- **serde/serde_json**: Configuration serialization
- **notify**: File system monitoring
- **tokio**: Async runtime for background tasks
- **anyhow/thiserror**: Error handling
- **hound**: Audio waveform processing
- **uuid**: Unique clip identifiers
- **dirs**: Cross-platform directory paths

### Core Features Implemented âœ…

#### Data Structures
- **Clip**: Complete metadata structure with trim points, audio tracks
- **AudioTrack**: Track configuration with surround options
- **ClipDuration**: Enum for hotkey durations (15s, 30s, 1m, 2m, 5m)
- **AppConfig**: Application configuration with directory paths

#### Hotkey System
- Global hotkey registration for Ctrl+1-5
- Event broadcasting system for clip requests
- Persistence-based duration request system
- Latest-request-wins duration assignment
- Background hotkey processing thread

#### Video Processing
- FFmpeg command-line integration for trimming
- Audio track mixing with surround support: FL|FR channel mapping allows tracks to be disabled separately while still being audible in mixed output
- Video info extraction (duration, audio tracks)
- Thumbnail generation capability
- Overwrite protection: Normal clicks prompt for confirmation, shift+click overwrites automatically

#### GUI Framework
- Main application window with egui
- Clip list sidebar
- Timeline editor framework
- Playback controls layout
- File management operations

#### File Management
- Configuration loading/saving with last watched directory restoration
- Directory organization (deleted/trimmed folders within watched directory)
- OBS replay file timestamp parsing
- Startup behavior: Restore last watched directory or wait for user selection if none exists

#### âœ… Advanced Duration Management - COMPLETED
- **Persistence System**: Duration requests saved to `%APPDATA%\clip-helper\duration_requests.json`
- **Multiple Changes**: Support for changing clip duration multiple times within 10-second window
- **Latest Wins**: Most recent hotkey press always takes precedence
- **Display-time Matching**: Duration assignment happens during UI rendering for immediate feedback
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old duration requests removed after 1 hour

## ðŸš§ NEXT STEPS - Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (Week 1-2)
1. **âœ… Hotkey Integration - COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Resolved global-hotkey API compatibility
   - âœ… Implemented persistence-based duration request system
   - âœ… Tested hotkey registration on Windows
   - âœ… Added latest-request-wins duration assignment

2. **âœ… File Monitoring - COMPLETED**  
   - âœ… Implemented real-time OBS file detection
   - âœ… Match duration requests to replay files at display time
   - âœ… Handle 10-second matching window with direction awareness

3. **âœ… Basic Video Preview - COMPLETED**
   - âœ… Embedded video player with FFmpeg integration
   - âœ… Hybrid architecture: instant seeking + smooth 30 FPS playback
   - âœ… Sequence tracking system to prevent position jumping
   - âœ… Non-blocking frame processing with proper aspect ratios
   - âœ… Integrated timeline scrubbing with immediate preview updates

### Phase 2: Timeline & Editing (Week 3-4)
1. **Timeline Widget**
   - Draggable timeline with scrubbing
   - Visual trim handles
   - Time display and markers

2. **Trim Controls**
   - Implement all trim adjustment buttons
   - Real-time preview updates
   - Precision time input

3. **Audio Waveform Display**
   - Generate waveforms for audio tracks
   - Visual representation in timeline
   - Track enable/disable controls

### Phase 3: Polish & Features (Week 5-6)
1. **Settings Dialog**
   - Directory configuration UI
   - FFmpeg path setup
   - Hotkey customization
   - Audio confirmation settings (output device selection, sound file choice)

2. **Batch Operations**
   - Multi-clip selection
   - Batch trim/delete operations
   - Export presets

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Background thumbnail generation
   - Waveform caching
   - Large file handling

## ðŸŽ¯ KEY TECHNICAL CHALLENGES TO SOLVE

### 1. Global Hotkey API
**Issue**: Current global-hotkey crate API version mismatch
**Solution**: 
- Update to compatible version or implement Windows-specific hotkeys
- Test hotkey registration and event handling
- Ensure hotkeys work when app is not focused

### 2. Video Preview Integration
**Issue**: Real-time video preview in egui
**Solution**:
- Use egui texture system for video frames
- Implement frame extraction at current position
- Optimize for smooth scrubbing experience

### 3. Timeline UI Component
**Issue**: Complex timeline widget with draggable elements
**Solution**:
- Custom egui widget with drag handles
- Timeline scrubbing with frame accuracy
- Visual feedback for trim points

### 4. FFmpeg Integration Robustness
**Issue**: Error handling and cross-platform paths
**Solution**:
- Better FFmpeg detection and error reporting
- Path handling for special characters
- Progress feedback for long operations
